Hello Daniel,

Here's my feedback on your project. I've included some points for preservation and some points for improvement. I hope you find it helpful.

Points for Improvement:

1. **Comments and Documentation**: The code lacks comments and documentation to help the reader understand the purpose and functionality of each class and method. While the code might be self-explanatory to some extent, good documentation is always a plus.

2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle**: In the view sets, the method `get_serializer_class` has repeated conditions for checking "PUT" and "POST" methods. This could be abstracted into a helper method for cleaner code.

3. **Model Relationships**: The `Review` model has a commented-out ForeignKey relationship with `User`. If it's not needed, it's better to remove it; otherwise, there should be a comment explaining why it is there.

4. **Type Annotations**: Although not strictly necessary in Python, type annotations can be helpful for readability and during development for catching type errors.

5. **Settings for `DecimalField`**: The `stars` field in the `Review` model might be better as an `IntegerField` unless you're aiming for granular ratings like 4.5 stars.

6. **Error Handling in Serializer**: In `RegisterUserSerializer`, there doesn't appear to be any error handling. What happens if the username or email is already in use?

Points for Preservation:

1. **Code Organization**: The code is well-organized. Separating the different parts of the Django app into models, serializers, and views is good practice.

2. **Consistent Styling**: The code style is consistent, adhering to standard Python naming conventions and Django best practices.

3. **Choice of Field Types**: The use of various field types in the models like `CharField`, `DecimalField`, and `URLField` is appropriate for the kind of data they are expected to store.

4. **Explicit Permission Classes**: The usage of permission classes in the views is a good practice to control access to the various endpoints.

Overall, you're on the right track, and I'm excited to see where you take this project. Keep it up!
